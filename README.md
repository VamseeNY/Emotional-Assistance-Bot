# Emotional-Assistance-Bot
The Tamil Mental-Health Voice Assistant is an end-to-end, voice-only AI system that converts a userâ€™s spoken Tamil (or mixed Tamil-English) question into an empathetic answer and then speaks that answer back to the user. 

# System Architecture
## Speech Recognition
- Whisper-small (98M parameters) used with Tamil forced decoding.
- The model outputs a string

## Natural language understanding and generation
- Gemma 3-1B fine-tuned on MentalChat16K dataset.
- Safety Guardrails implemented using domain-restricted system prompt.

## Speech Synthesis
- Meta MMS TTS model implemented with fixed style descriptor for consistent output. 
- The model returns an output audio file

- Error handling strategy: catch-and-log at each stage, return user-friendly fallback message on failure.
